        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The Sustainer consists of 6 modules. There are two oscillator sections, which can make different kinds of
            sounds. They are mixed together, and then sent to the filter, which will filter out some parts of the
            signal, while amplifying others. The resulting signal is sent to a power amplifier which drives a speaker.
            There is also three low frequency oscillators which can be used to change the frequency (modulate) the
            audio oscillators.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Oscillator A</h3>
          <p>
            The second oscillator section consists of two Schmitt trigger oscillators, where the first one is connected
            to the second one by a diode. This allows it to gate the second oscillator, producing interesting
            harmonics. This only works when the first oscillator has a lower frequency then the second one, therefore
            it has a bigger timing capacitor.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>The Schmitt trigger oscillator</h4>
            <figure class="right"><img src="img/simple_oscillator.png"><figcaption>A very simple oscillator</figcaption></figure>
            <p>
              The Schmitt trigger is a type of comparator, that will compare the voltage on the input to an internal
              reference created between the power supply and ground. The output can be eiter maximum (close to the
              power supply) or minimum (ground), and it will high when the output is low and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes this useful as an oscillator is that the threshold voltage is not half way between the power
              supply and ground, but 1/3 and 2/3 of the way. When the output is already low, the input needs to drop to
              1/3 of the power supply voltage to trigger a change, and when the output is high, the input needs to rise
              to 2/3.
            </p>
            <p>
              By connecting a capacitor between the ground and input, and a resistor between those two and the output,
              we can use the output from the Schmitt trigger to charge the capacitor. As the capacitor is charged, it
              will start to develop a voltage drop due to the current accumulating, and this will be sensed as the
              input voltage of the Schmitt trigger. When the capacitor is charged enough, the input voltage will reach
              the threshold to trigger the comparator to go low. When this happens, the capacitor will start to
              discharge back through the resistor, and the input voltage will start to fall towards the lower threshold
              voltage again, thus beginning the cycle again.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using a variable resistor between the output and the capacitor, we can control the frequency of the
              oscillator. Different combinations of capacitors and variable resistors can be used and will give
              different frequency ranges. A fixed resistor to limit the frequency should also be used.

          <h3>Oscillator B</h3>
          <p>
            This oscillator section consists of a Schmitt trigger oscillator connected to a 555 timer configured as a
            monostable multivibrator.

          <h3>Mixing</h3>
          <p>
            Since the output from the two oscillator sections are square waves, the circuit uses a CD4060 XOR gate to
            mix the signals together. This produces not only a sum of the waves, but also the sum and difference of the
            frequencies, which sounds very interesting.

          <h3>Low Frequency Oscillators</h3>
          <p>
            There are three low frequency oscillators (LFOs) that can be used to modulate the main audio oscillators.
            They are made with Schmitt triggers, and use different timing capacitors so they have different frequency
            ranges. The signal from the LFOs can be modified by a caacitor to make it more rounded.

          <h3>General information</h3>
          <p>
            If you haven't soldered before, I suggest you either get someone to help you get started, or at least watch
            some tutorials about it. It's not difficult, but it requires some practice. The IC sockets are good to
            begin with, sice they are quite easy to solder, and difficult to destry. Patience is key when soldering. Go
            slow and double check each component. Use a little solder at a time, and remember that it's easier to add a
            little more to a joint than to remove excess solder. I suggest you read this instruction carefully before
            you start and make sure you understand it. Keep it handy throughout the work.

          <section>
            <h4>Identifying the different components on the PCB</h4>
            <p>
              The PCB has several types of components, and they are marked with a code consisting of one or two letters
              and numbers. The letter(s) indicate the type of component, and the number is simply a numbering for each
              one. Here is a list of the components used on the Sustainer PCB, and their corresponding identification
              letter. The list is in alphabetical order. Some of the components are not soldered directly to the PCB,
              this is indicated in the table.

            <h4>Soldering order</h4>
            <p>
              The following soldering order is my suggestion, but you can solder in any order you like. However, generally
              it's recommended to start with the lowest components and then do taller and taller ones.
              Some components, like the ICs, transistors and some capacitors, have a specific orientation, while others
              will work no matter which way you solder them. In some cases, like the ICs and the capacitors, soldering them
              the wrong way can lead to damage, while others will just not work, or in the case of the potentiometers, they
              will work oposite of what you might expect.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Start with the IC sockets. Insert them and bend the leg of two corners to keep it in place, then turn the
                PCB and solder. Pay attention to the orientation. I suggest that you solder all of them at the same time
                to help balance the PCB.
              </li>
              <li>
                Next solder the resistors, and the diode. Bend the leads and insert them flush with the PCB, then bend
                the leads to the side to keep them in place. Trim away long leads.
              </li>
              <li>
                The next components are the small ceramic capacitors. Agan insert, bend, solder and trim.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transistors are next. The holes for the leads are quite close together, so be careful when soldering. You
                also need to pay attention to the orientation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Next solder the film capacitors. These are easy, just do the same as with the ceramic caps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, the electrolytic capacitors, from small to tall. Easy to solder, but be careful about the orientation.

          <h3>Soldering potentiometers, switches and other wiring</h3>
            Here is where most mistakes are made, so be very careful when doing the wiring. Be frugal with the wire so you
            don't run out. The color doesn't matter, but red i usually for power, and black is usually ground.
            <section>
              <h4>Soldering potentiometers</h4>
              <figure class="right"><img src="img/potentiometer_tab.jpg"><figcaption>You can remove this tab</figcaption></figure>
              <figure class="right"><img src="img/potentiometer_pins.jpg"><figcaption>The order of the pins</figcaption></figure>
              <p>
                The PCB markings indicates which hole should be connected to pin 1, 2 and 3 of the potentiometers. See
                the image to match them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The potentiometers also have a small tab which is inserted into a smaller hole
                to prevent them from turning, but I find that they get are more a hinder than a help. They can be
                removed easily by grabbing them with a plier and simply twisted off.
              </p>
              <section>
                <h5>Replacing potentiometers with Photoresistors</h5>
                  Photoresistors are light sensitive resistors. They can be great for controlling the Sustainer, although not
                  very accurate, but this might just make them more fun. It's easy to replace most of the potentiometers with
                  photoresistors.
                  Many of the potentiometes are used as variable resistors (as opposed to voltage dividers). You can recognize
                  these by the fact that the center leg and one of the outer legs are connected. In these cases, you can simply
                  connect the photoresistor between the legs that are <b>not</b> connected in the circuit.
                  Example: You want to replace RV1 in the circuit, which is the filter cutoff controll. You need to solder the
                  leads of the photoresistor into hole 1/2 and 3, since 1 and 2 are connected.

              <h4>Connecting the LFOs to the oscillators</h4>
              <p>
                The low frequency oscillators are used to modulate the audio oscillator. They are made using three of
                the six units inside the CD40106 (U2). In order to connect them to the oscillators, cables must be used
                across the board. The connectors J1, J2 and J3 are the LFO outputs, and they can be connected to J4, J5
                and J6 however you like. They have somewhat different frequency range.
